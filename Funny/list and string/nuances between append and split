#when operating list.append and string.split
n = [] #cell 1
num1 = 3 #cell 2
n.append(num1)  #cell 3
n  #cell 4
#only cell 4 has output: [3]

a = 'a\nb' #cell 5
a.split('\n') #cell 6
#Output: ['a', 'b']
#Here I wanna illuatrate for append it change the orignal list and if you wanna some output you need to recall the list
#and for split, it does not change the orignal string value, and when you split the string, you get the split result immediately
