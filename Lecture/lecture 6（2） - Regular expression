#Regular Expression
#also referred to as 'regex' or 'regexp' 
#really clever 'wild card' expression for matching and parsing string
#very powerful and quite cryptic / fun once you understand them / 
#How could we 'concisely' describe a string denotes an integar value?
#"one or more digit characters"

#a regular expression for integers:
integer = [0-9]+  #It will cover '00001', '1235' +: one or more occurance of these characters

#if we wanted to make sure to exclude numbers that start with '0's:
integer = [1-9][0-9]* #first digit is from 1 to 9, second is 0-9, and * means 0/more occurance of these characters

#real number:
real = [+\-][0-9]+\.[0-9]+   #[+\-]: \is to escape -, because - is also used for range, \.is also used to escape.
