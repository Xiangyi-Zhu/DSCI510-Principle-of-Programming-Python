(1) There are three modules created in this project, namely, scraper.py, apifunction.py, fromstringtoint.py.
scraper.py is used to web scraping.
apifunction.py is used to utilizing OpenCageGeocode API
fromstringtoint.py is used to extract integer from string.

(2)  ScriptRunCMD.py is the py file ran from the command line. When you run this .py file, the modules scraper, apifunction and 
fromstringtoint are imported using import statements.

(3) There are three datasets in this folder, namely, datafromKaggleCA.csv, datafromZillow.csv, datasetfromKaggle.csv.
datafromKaggle.csv is the dataset downloaded from Kaggle,
datafromZillow.csv is the output of web scaping and API process,
datafromKaggleCA.csv is the output of data processing of datafromKaggle.csv.

(4) The Project description.pdf is the report.

(5) ScriptRunCMD.ipynb, it is the .ipynb version of ScriptRunCMD.py file. 

(6) I also attached the Output_in_CMD.pdf file, which shows the screenshots when ScriptRunCMD.py runs at my CMD. 

*The Python version I used in my project is 3.9
*The step for API processing needs around 5 min in CMD.
