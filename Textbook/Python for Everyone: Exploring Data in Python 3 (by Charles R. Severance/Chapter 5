#Chapter 5: Iteration


# 5.1 Updating variables: where the new value of the varible depends on the old
x = 5
x = x + 1
print(x)


#5.2 One form of iteration: The while statement
#countdown case (has iteration variable n)
n = 5
while n > 0:
   print(n)
   n = n - 1
print('Blastoff')
#it has five iterations, which means the body of loop was executed five times


#5.3 Infinite loops
n = 10
while True:
   print(n, end = ' ')
   n = n - 1
   break
print('Done')
print(n)
# Output: 10 Done
#         9

while True:
   line = input('> ')
   if line == 'done':
       break
   print(line)
print('Done!')
