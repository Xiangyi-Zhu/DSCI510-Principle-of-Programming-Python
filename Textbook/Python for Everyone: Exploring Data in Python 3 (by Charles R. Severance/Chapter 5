#Chapter 5: Iteration


# 5.1 Updating variables: where the new value of the varible depends on the old
x = 5
x = x + 1
print(x)


#5.2 One form of iteration: The while statement
#countdown case (has iteration variable n)
n = 5
while n > 0:
   print(n)
   n = n - 1
print('Blastoff')
#it has five iterations, which means the body of loop was executed five times


#5.3 Infinite loops
n = 10
while True:
   print(n, end = ' ')
   n = n - 1
   break
print('Done')
print(n)
# Output: 10 Done
#         9

while True:
   line = input('> ')
   if line == 'done':
       break
   print(line)
print('Done!')


#5.4 Finish iterations with continue
while True:
   line = input('> ')
   if line[0] == '#':
      continue
   if line == 'done':
      break
   print(line)
print('Done!')
#All the lines are printed except the one starts with the hash sign, when continue is executed, it ends the current iteration and jumps back to the while statement to start the next iteration.


#5.5 Definite loops using for
#loop through a set of things such as a list of words
friends = ['Joe', 'Anna', 'Joy']
for name in friends:
   print('Happy New Year:', name)
print('Done')
#both name and friends are variables, and friend is iteration varible
