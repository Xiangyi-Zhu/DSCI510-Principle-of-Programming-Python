#The task of searching and extracting is so common that python has a powerful library , called regular expressions
#which can handle these kind of tasks elegantly

#Although very powerful, they are a little complicated and their syntax takes some getting used to.

#Regular expression are almost their own little programming language for searching and parsing strings. 

#The regular expression library must be imported into your program before you can use it

#Search function (the simplest use of re library)
#example: search for lines that contain 'From':
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('From:', line): #can use line.find() instead
        print(line)
#This program does not use the real power of re, since we could use line.find() to accomplish the same result. 

#Adding these (special characters) allows us to do sophisticated matching and extraction while writing very little code.
#e.g. The caret character is used to match "the beginning" of a line
#we can change our program to only match lines where "From:" was at the beginning of the line as follows
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^From:', line):
        print(line)
 #Can use line.startswith instead
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From:', 0,5):
        print(line)
        
#11.1 Character matching in regular expressions
#There are a number of special characters that let us build even more powerful regular expression.
#period or full stop matches any characters
#Example: search for lines that start with 'F', followed by 2 characters, followed by 'm'
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('F..m:', line):
        print(line)
