#The task of searching and extracting is so common that python has a powerful library , called regular expressions
#which can handle these kind of tasks elegantly

#Although very powerful, they are a little complicated and their syntax takes some getting used to.

#Regular expression are almost their own little programming language for searching and parsing strings. 

#The regular expression library must be imported into your program before you can use it

#Search function (the simplest use of re library)
#example: search for lines that contain 'From':
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('From:', line):
        print(line)
#This program does not use the real power of re, since we could use line.find() to accomplish the same result.
