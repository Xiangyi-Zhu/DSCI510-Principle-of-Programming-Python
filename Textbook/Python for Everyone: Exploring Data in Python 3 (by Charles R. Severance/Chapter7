#Chapter 7: Files
#7.1 Persistance
#So far, we have learned how to write programs and communicate our intentions to the CPU, using conditional execution, function, and iterations. 
#We have learned how to create and use data structure in the Main Memory.
#The CPU and memory are where our software works and runs.
#But if you recall from our hardware architecture discussions, once the power is turned off, anything stored 
#either in the CPU or main memory is erased. 
#In this chapter, we start to work with secondary memory, which is not erased whe the power is turned off. 
#We will primarily focus on reading and writing text files 

#7.2 Opening files
#Opening the file communications with your operating system, which knows where the data for each file is stored.
#In this example, we open the file mbox.txt, which should be stored in the same folder that you are in when you start Python.
fhand = open('mbox.txt')
print(fhand)

#7.3 Text files and lines
#newline character in Python is \n, even though it looks like two characters, it is actually a single character. 
stuff = 'Hello\nWorld'
stuff
print(stuff)
len(stuff)    #Note: \n is treated as one character
#Output: 'Hello\nWorld'
#         Hello
#         World
#         11
#So when we look at the lines in a file, we need to imagine that there is a special invisible character called newline at the end of each line,
#which seperates the characters in the file into lines.
